# My Bioinformatics Learning Journey 🧬💻

This repository documents my transition from Pharmacy to Bioinformatics, showcasing Python tools developed to solve real-world biological and clinical problems.

## 🚀 Projects & Exercises

### 1. Clinical Dosage & Safety Basics
**Stage:** Python Basics & Mathematical Modeling.
- **Description:** A simple tool for calculating patient-specific dosages and checking basic safety interactions.
- **Files:** `Clinical_Dosage_Analyzer.ipynb`

### 2. Pharmacogenomics (PGx) Support Tool
**Stage:** Data Management & Clinical Logic.
- **Description:** An exercise to link genomic variants (e.g., CYP2C19) with drug recommendations based on CPIC guidelines.
- **Files:** `PGx_Analysis_Tool.ipynb`, `drugsdata.csv`

### 3. DNA Sequence Mutation Scanner
**Stage:** Advanced Logic & Genomic Parsing.
- **Description:** A tool that searches for specific gene segments (Motifs) within raw DNA sequences. It calculates sequence length and detects "Frameshift Mutations" by validating if the segment length is a multiple of 3 (Codon logic).
- **Files:** `DNA_Sequence_Analysis.ipynb`

### 4. Protein Synthesis & Mutation Analyzer
**Stage:** Biochemical Modeling & Physicochemical Analysis.

* **Description:** A more advanced tool that simulates the translation of mRNA into protein sequences. It features a mutation simulator and calculates the total Molecular Weight (in Daltons) of the resulting protein, helping to visualize the impact of Nonsense and Missense mutations.
* **Files:** `Protein_Synthesis_Tool.ipynb`
